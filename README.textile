h1. AnalyticsGoo

AnalyticsGoo is a plugin that provides server side non-javascript tracking using google analytics. 


h2. Example

In your environment.rb add something like the following:

<pre>
  <code>
   AnalyticsGoo.config(:name => :test,
                       :analytics_id => "UA-3536616-5", 
                       :domain => "demo.eyestreet.com",
                       :type => :google_analytics)
  </code>
</pre> 

* name - A name for your analytics tracking (TODO: allow support for multiple accounts)
* analytics id - Your google account
* domain - The domain that should be set for the the GA tracking
* analytics type - Currently we only support :google_analytics

Then in your models, controllers, and mailers you can do the following:

<pre>
  <code>
     user = User.find(:first)
     user.track_page_view("/found_my_first_user")
  </code>
</pre>
