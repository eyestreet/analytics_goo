  # Factory for returning the appropriate analytics object. The <tt>type</tt> is
  # a symbol that defines the type of analytics tracker you want to create. Currently,
  # the only acceptable value is :google_analytics. The <tt>analytics</tt> hash holds
  # the name, analytics_id, and domain of the adapter that you are configuring. You can also
  # pass in a hash of hashes with multiple accounts. Setting <tt>rails_core_mixins</tt> to
  # true will mixin an accessor for this object into the core rails framework classes (active_record, action_controller and action_mailer). The default
  # for this is false so that there are no rails dependencies on the gem. The <tt>env</tt> by default is set to "production". The
  # rails mixin functionality checks this value against its RAILS_ENV then it calls out to the analytics only if the value is nil or matches.
